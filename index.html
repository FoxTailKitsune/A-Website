    <h5> In short, this website was made with the goal of hosting a really shoddy rip-off of Club Penguin. However, I soon realized I was being way too ambitious considering the only coding I had done before this was about 2 weeks of HTML in 6th grade, so I just stuck to making a pseudo-functional website. I want to thank my friends/teammates who contributed absolutely nothing except inspiring me to come up with the Club Penguin idea, which greatly affected the direction of this project. Instead, you, the viewer, get to spectate my technological prowess as I wow you with things I learned off the internet a couple hours ago and replicated within this site. </h5>

    <h5> If you would kindly look towards the upper right-hand side, you will see my major and only accomplishment in this website: a theme switch. The theme switch is vital to modern websites which are commonly accessed at any hour of the night, and as such, require a darker background so as not to damage your eyes. I did this by trying and failing to understand about 3 lines of JavaScript and spending 40 minutes troubleshooting because I made typos everywhere. Truly an enjoyable first experience. </h5>
